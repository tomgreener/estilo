## What's included?

TBC.

## Anything else to come?
Some things I may add in future are:

- Prefixing groups of variables with a common base name (e.g. `$color-`), to allow code editors to list all related variables when a user types the first part
- Switch horizontal/vertical rhythmn from SCSS variables to CSS variables, to allow them to be easily changed client-side inside media query tags (will require [this polyfill](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/css-vars-ponyfill) for oldest browsers)
- Lint and process repo code using PostCSS
- Add double gutter width grid
- Align with [Airbnb CSS style guides](https://github.com/airbnb/css)
